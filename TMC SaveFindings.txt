These are my Findings on how a Tomodachi Collection Save File Works.
Due to bugs with GitHub's text encoder, Some of the symbols will appear to be blank. There are no Spaces in the examples, The spaces will represent a 00 Byte in hexadecimal. 
I created an island with the name "test" that has 3 Male generic mii islanders. All with maximum personality stats
and the same voice. 

Mii 1: test
Mii 2: test1
Mii 3: test2

lines 0 through F0 appear to be Island Information. With the island name being saved on line 80.

At line 800, The string "akstnhmyrwgzdbp" can be found. 

At like 8F0, the string "YRG—" can be found.

Each set of data for a Mii Character will always start with "MaaMiiMuuMeeMoo"

At line 1000, Consisting until line 1300, the data for Mii 1 Can be found.

At line 1300, the data for Mii 2 Can be found, This looks nearly identical to Mii 1's Data, So an example isn't necessary.

Same for line 1600.

Every 300 lines from this point onwards until 13BF0 is the data for the next Mii Character, Which in this case, is blank.


At line 13BF0, The string "‡x|×" is found


The next section of data is Blank until line 3DBF0, Where the string "aadeeiKlLnnrrst" appears, Follwed by a pattern of "   ÿ  ÿ  ÿ  ÿ  ÿ" that continues until line 3DE60.

At line 3DEF0, the string "Sm»tsumanogosakata" appears.

At line 3F8F0, the string "Z6X¿N-EAST-WEST-S   ›       r B«a   Ÿ       ? BëB   ž       E  B| appears.

Starting at line 3FBF0, A combination of FF and 00 Bytes appears, with 2 Strings also inserted. "?90hBusGasExplosion" and "¾8gÌKyotoOsakaNara"

At line 40000, The string "TOMODACHI-FAIRY" appears again, This time with more island information, Including the island name.

The rest of this section is Identical, With maybe some minor differences. 

I am unsure what encryption method is used for this, However this information may be useful in creating a save editor in the future.
