A work in progress tool to edit a Tomodachi Collection save file. 


Mii2QR: An EXE File that will take a Mii Character from the .sav file and convert it into a Mii QR Code for 3DS/Wii U. (Tomodachi Life compatibility planned at secondary priority).

THANK YOU IMMENSELEY [@SporyTike] and Griffin for their Assistance and Research on the Mii Data Structure in Tomodachi Collection <3.

I plan on using Visual Basic for the window GUI itself, As opposed to a command-line based program. This project is currently 0% Complete.
