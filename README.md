A work in progress tool to edit a Tomodachi Collection save file. 


Mii2QR: A program that will take a Mii Character from the .sav file and convert it into a Mii QR Code for 3DS/Wii U. It will also contain Tomodachi Life specific data, including Personality, Catchphrase, Full Name, DOB, Blood Type (Researching), and in the future, potentially Voice Data. 

THANK YOU FOR LITERALLY DOING 66% OF THE QR CONVERTER WORK AHEAD OF TIME [@ariankordi](https://github.com/ariankordi).

THANK YOU IMMENSELEY [@SporyTike](https://github.com/SporyTike), and NiterZ7 for their Assistance and Research on the Memory Structure in Tomodachi Collection <3.


I plan on using Visual Basic for the window GUI itself, As opposed to a command-line based program. This project is currently 0% Complete.
