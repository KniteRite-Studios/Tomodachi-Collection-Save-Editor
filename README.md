A work in progress tool to edit a Tomodachi Collection save file. 


Mii2QR: An EXE File that will take a Mii Character from the .sav file and convert it into a Mii QR Code for 3DS/Wii U. (Tomodachi Life compatibility planned at secondary priority).

THANK YOU FOR LITERALLY DOING 66% OF THE QR CONVERTER WORK AHEAD OF TIME [@ariankordi](https://github.com/ariankordi)
THANK YOU IMMENSELEY [@SporyTike](https://github.com/SporyTike), and NiterZ7 for their Assistance and Research on the Memory Structure in Tomodachi Collection <3.


I plan on using Visual Basic for the window GUI itself, As opposed to a command-line based program. This project is currently 0% Complete.
